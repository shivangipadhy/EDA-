# EDA-
In statistics, exploratory data analysis is a method of examining data sets to highlight their key features, frequently utilizing statistical graphics and other techniques for data visualization.
EDA's major goal is to encourage data analysis before making any assumptions. It can assist in finding glaring errors, better understanding data patterns, spotting outliers or unusual occurrences, and discovering intriguing relationships between the variables.

Why should EDA come before modeling?
Introduction. It is frequently crucial to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) before to fitting any model in order to verify presumptions, examine the data for anomalies (such as missing, duplicate, or incorrectly coded data), and provide guidance on feature selection and transformation.

EDA is used to analyze the data and compile the most important conclusions. It will provide you with a fundamental grasp of your data, including its distribution, null values, and other factors.Data exploration options include using graphs and various Python tools.There are two different types of analysis. both bivariate and univariate. You will be examining a single attribute in the univariate case. However, while doing a bivariate analysis, you will combine an attribute with the target attribute.You will use methods like shape, summary, describe, isnull, info, datatypes, and more in the non-graphical manner.You will use plots including scatter, box, bar, density, and correlation plots in the graphical method.
The most crucial element of any analysis is EDA. You will learn a great deal about your data. The majority of your questions will have an answer thanks to EDA. I've made an effort to demonstrate the majority of the Python functions used for data exploration with graphics.
